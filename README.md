### Sum Assessed Value by Year
Upon examining the total assessed value over the years, we observe a gradual upward trajectory from approximately $8 billion in the early years to roughly $15 billion by 2004. Following a significant drop to around $10.7 billion, the value stabilized within a range of $8 billion to $12.8 billion for several years. This relative stability was eventually broken in 2017, marking the beginning of a gradual rise culminating in a peak of approximately $17 billion in 2020. Notably, the total sum of sales depicted in the lower right card visual stands at  $227.75 billion.

### Average Sale Amount by Year

Examining the average sale amount over time reveals a dynamic and somewhat unpredictable journey. Starting at around $95k,, it soars to a remarkable peak of $430k in 2007. However, two years later, it takes a plunge down to around $306k in 2009. Instead of settling into a stable range, the average sale amount embarks on a rollercoaster ride, experiencing ups and downs until 2019, where it finds itself hovering around $333k. But the story doesn't end there. In a dramatic turn of events, it takes off once again in 2019, surging to a new peak of $454k in 2021. Notably, the overall average sale amount stands at $345.03k, as shown in the card visual to the right.

### Sum Sale Amount by Year


Delving into the total sales figures unveils a captivating story. We witness a surge in sales, culminating in an all-time high of about $28.3 billion in 2005. However, a gradual downward trend sets in, bringing the figure down to approximately $10.3 billion by 2011. The subsequent years show a relative stabilization, with sales fluctuating, ultimately reaching $21.9 billion in 2021. Notably, the total sum of sales, as displayed in the card visual, stands at an impressive $343.13 billion.

Interestingly, comparing this figure to the total assessed value reveals a significant difference of around $115.38 billion. This suggests that, on average, properties typically sell for considerably more than their assessed value, showcasing the dynamic interplay between market forces and official valuations.

### Property Type



A quick glance at the bar chart reveals the industrial property type has the highest average values, with an average sale amount of approximately $1 million. This impressive figure stands out against the other categories, showcasing the substantial value industrial properties command in the market.

Looking into the next chart (pie chart), we see a different picture. Single-family properties take center stage, accounting for a dominant 65% of total property sales. This overwhelming majority clearly demonstrates the prevalence and popularity of single-family homes in the market.

But the story deepens when we zoom further into the plot. While industrial properties constitute only 0.04% of sales, their average sale amount significantly surpasses the overall average. This contrast with single-family properties, which are more numerous but have an average sale amount slightly above the overall average.

### Average Residential Property Type
A quick glance at the chart reveals single-family homes claiming the top spot, boasting the highest average sale amount among all residential property types.

### Duration of Property Sales
The pie chart paints a fascinating picture of property sale durations, with a whopping 75% of transactions occurring within a year. This suggests a relatively fast-paced market, where properties generally find buyers within a reasonably short timeframe. However, a closer look at the card visual in the lower right corner reveals a nuanced reality. While the majority of sales happen quickly, there are still 12 houses that spent over a year on the market, indicating that longer sales cycles do exist for a smaller segment of properties.
