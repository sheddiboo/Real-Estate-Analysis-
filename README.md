# Property Valuation Trends: A Visual Exploration


### Average Assessed Value by Year
Based on the chart below, the average assessed value has exhibited an upward trend over the years, commencing at $134,000 and reaching its peak at $315,000 in 2011. Subsequently, there was a gradual decline, concluding at $262,000 in the year 2020. It is noteworthy that the card visual in the top right corner provides an overview of the overall assessed value, indicating a figure of $229,010. This analysis underscores the dynamic nature of property assessments over the specified timeframe.


### Sum Assessed Value by Year
Upon examining the total assessed value over the years, we observe a gradual upward trajectory from approximately $8 billion in the early years to roughly $15 billion by 2004. Following a significant drop to around $10.7 billion, the value stabilized within a range of $8 billion to $12.8 billion for several years. This relative stability was eventually broken in 2017, marking the beginning of a gradual rise culminating in a peak of approximately $17 billion in 2020. Notably, the total sum of sales depicted in the lower right card visual stands at  $227.75 billion.


### Average Sale Amount by Year

Examining the average sale amount over time reveals a dynamic and somewhat unpredictable journey. Starting at around $95k,, it soars to a remarkable peak of $430k in 2007. However, two years later, it takes a plunge down to around $306k in 2009. Instead of settling into a stable range, the average sale amount embarks on a rollercoaster ride, experiencing ups and downs until 2019, where it finds itself hovering around $333k. But the story doesn't end there. In a dramatic turn of events, it takes off once again in 2019, surging to a new peak of $454k in 2021. Notably, the overall average sale amount stands at $345.03k, as shown in the card visual to the right.



### Sum Sale Amount by Year


Delving into the total sales figures unveils a captivating story. We witness a surge in sales, culminating in an all-time high of about $28.3 billion in 2005. However, a gradual downward trend sets in, bringing the figure down to approximately $10.3 billion by 2011. The subsequent years show a relative stabilization, with sales fluctuating, ultimately reaching $21.9 billion in 2021. Notably, the total sum of sales, as displayed in the card visual, stands at an impressive $343.13 billion.

Interestingly, comparing this figure to the total assessed value reveals a significant difference of around $115.38 billion. This suggests that, on average, properties typically sell for considerably more than their assessed value, showcasing the dynamic interplay between market forces and official valuations.


### Property Type



A quick glance at the bar chart reveals the industrial property type has the highest average values, with an average sale amount of approximately $1 million. This impressive figure stands out against the other categories, showcasing the substantial value industrial properties command in the market.





Looking into the next chart (pie chart), we see a different picture. Single-family properties take center stage, accounting for a dominant 65% of total property sales. This overwhelming majority clearly demonstrates the prevalence and popularity of single-family homes in the market.




But the story deepens when we zoom further into the plot. While industrial properties constitute only 0.04% of sales, their average sale amount significantly surpasses the overall average. This contrast with single-family properties, which are more numerous but have an average sale amount slightly above the overall average.


### Average Residential Property Type
A quick glance at the chart reveals single-family homes claiming the top spot, boasting the highest average sale amount among all residential property types. While their prevalence may not be explicitly depicted here, their financial strength is evident, demonstrating a clear preference in the market.


### Duration of Property Sales
The pie chart paints a fascinating picture of property sale durations, with a whopping 75% of transactions occurring within a year. This suggests a relatively fast-paced market, where properties generally find buyers within a reasonably short timeframe. However, a closer look at the card visual in the lower right corner reveals a nuanced reality. While the majority of sales happen quickly, there are still 12 houses that spent over a year on the market, indicating that longer sales cycles do exist for a smaller segment of properties.
